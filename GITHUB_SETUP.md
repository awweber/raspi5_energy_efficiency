# GitHub Publishing Instructions

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (if available)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push the repository with:

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create energy-efficiency-embedded-linux --public --description "Energy Efficiency Optimization for Embedded Linux Systems using cpufreq and power management"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Manual GitHub Setup

1. **Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository:**
   - Repository name: `energy-efficiency-embedded-linux`
   - Description: `Energy Efficiency Optimization for Embedded Linux Systems using cpufreq and power management`
   - Make it Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Use these:**

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/energy-efficiency-embedded-linux.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main  # Optional: rename master to main
git push -u origin main
```

OR if you want to keep the master branch:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin  
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/energy-efficiency-embedded-linux.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 3: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
# Add SSH remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/energy-efficiency-embedded-linux.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## After Publishing

1. **Add repository topics/tags on GitHub:**
   - embedded-linux
   - energy-efficiency  
   - cpufreq
   - power-management
   - c-programming
   - raspberry-pi
   - embedded-systems

2. **Consider adding a LICENSE file:**
   - MIT License is commonly used for educational projects
   - GPL if you want to ensure derivatives remain open source

3. **Update README with GitHub badges:**
   - Build status
   - License badge
   - Language statistics

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in the commands above.
